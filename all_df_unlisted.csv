You will write and test your code, and work with our QA team to get it deployed to production. With the help of a homegrown, bot-driven CI/CD pipeline, your code will be delivered to users daily. This cross-functional team leverages Amazon Web Services for everything from ECS for containerized virtualization and hosting, to S3 for durable object storage, RDS and DynamoDB for persistence, EMR for the batch processing of billions of records, and Lambda for distributed workloads and stream consumption.Aside from the day to day, we can offer you incredible benefits including an annual continuing education budget, a trust-focused development process, a flexible and collaborative work environment where balance matters, stock ownership, and an annual company retreat.The team strives to be ego-free and motivated only by building amazing software for our users. We seek to understand the ""why"" behind the ""what"". We regularly break out into small teams to tackle problems, learn new technologies, or just share what we know with others. We test our code and invest in the health of our systems. We push each other, learn from each other, and strive to continually grow.Primary ResponsibilitiesYou will...Work with stakeholders to define the solutions to development problems and business requirementsDevelop and maintain the features and capabilities of our data ingestion pipelinesExtract actionable and impactful insights from vast amounts of dataDevelop and maintain the services that surface those insights and make them available for consumption in a performant mannerCreate unit and integration tests for your codeReproduce and fix bugs reported by internal and external usersSet goals and communicate often about your progress toward themContribute to the ongoing improvement of the engineering organization and our softwareWhat We’re Looking ForA problem solver at heartMuch of our work revolves around problems that have no existing off-the-shelf solution or consensus on best practices. You'll often need to break down large problems into smaller more manageable tasks and utilize critical thinking to come up with novel ideas.3+ years of engineering experienceThings move quickly in the data group. You’ll need to be comfortable and familiar with delivering highly scalable cloud based applications.Professional experience with frameworks like Hadoop, Spark, or similarThis will be a significant component of your responsibilities. You will be working with large data sets in a distributed environment on a daily basis. Familiarity w/ the Hadoop/Spark ecosystem is a must.Professional experience with Python data toolsOur data team uses PySpark and Jupyter notebooks extensively. Familiarity with these technologies will also serve you well.Direct experience with relational and NoSQL databases technologiesWe use the best tool for the job around here. When it comes to storing and accessing data, we recognize that the technology decisions we make directly impact our ability to provide a performant customer experience, and our own costs.Experience designing and building JSON based RESTful APIsBecause we are building our application with a front end framework, we carefully design and document the APIs to power it. To help us, we follow the JSON API spec, but any experience in building a RESTful API will be useful. Remember, the API is your contract with the consumers of your data!Understanding of monolithic and micro-service based architecturesIZEAx still has some legacy monolithic characteristics. We move more and more of our technology to a distributed set of services, there are new challenges to overcome. Understanding the differences between these two models will help you take those challenges head on.Basic Linux skillsIn order to develop our data pipelines and services, you need to run it on your laptop. This means opening up some terminal windows, running some commands, and keeping the log output open. Additionally, some of our technology stack is better accessed through CLIs. Examples include the Ember CLI, the Rails CLI/console, Docker commands, Gradle, and our own CLIs. We'll walk you through it, but you should be comfy in a terminal.Ability to multitask and prioritize multiple incoming requestsIZEA's Engineering team strives to provide a great experience and great service to our users. In order to do that, you may need to context switch into a support issue or drop what you are doing to start work on something else. This is part of what Agile means to us.Excellent verbal and written communications skillsRegular and timely communication is the key to a trust based development process. You should be able to simply and concisely ask for feedback and direction in terms that your audience understands, and relay requested information in a timely fashion to your leaders. You should prioritize documentation of processes and code.Demonstrated experience with the following will be highly valuedData Science BackgroundWhile not required, a fundamental understanding of statistics and modeling would be a great asset. Practical experience with Machine Learning and/or complex data pipelines would also be welcome.Front End development experienceFrom time to time you may need to build visualization, or (lite) user facing experiences. Familiarity with modern web frameworks like Angular, React, Ember, or Vue would be helpful. Extra bonus points if you have familiarity w/ Javascript based visualization libraries like d3.js or Highcharts.Amazon Web Services, or other cloud providersIZEA's software is hosted on AWS, and you will need to acquire some familiarity with it. Previous experience in using a cloud provider, even if just for developer tooling, shows that you understand some of the nuances involved in working in the cloud. Familiarity with Amazon’s EMR would also be an asset.Continuous Integration & DeploymentIZEA needs to get features and fixes out to customers as soon as we possibly can with as much confidence as possible. To facilitate this, we have developed a CI/CD pipeline (using 3rd party services). An understanding of what CI/CD is will help you understand how this pipeline works and how to make it even better.GitHubAll of IZEA's code is source controlled on Github. We leverage Github Pull Requests for code reviews, Github integrations manage parts of our CI/CD pipeline, and Github releases define the code tags that ultimately get deployed. Much of our process documentation exists on Github pages. Familiarity with navigating Github's features will help you ramp up in our SDLC faster.JIRAIZEA uses JIRA to manage projects and report on progress to stakeholders inside and outside the company. While we strive to automate as much of JIRA as possible with bots, webhooks and reports, understanding how JIRA issues, links, attachments, and workflows work will help you understand our SDLC faster.About IZEA:We are IZEA: The Creator Marketplace. Our cloud-based technologies connect Brands and Publishers with content Creators who blog, tweet, pin, and post on their behalf.Our driving belief is that the only way to thrive in our rapidly changing world is to change ahead of it.

Familiarity with Amazon’s EMR would also be an asset.Continuous Integration & DeploymentIZEA needs to get features and fixes out to customers as soon as we possibly can with as much confidence as possible. To facilitate this, we have developed a CI/CD pipeline (using 3rd party services).

Postdoctoral Fellow in Machine Learning,H. Lee Moffitt Cancer Center,"Tampa, FL 33637","Postdoctoral Fellow in Machine LearningTumor evolution proceeds at a rapid pace. Drug development does not. In order for cancer therapy to achieve a durable response over years rather than months, it must ""evolve"" as quickly as the tumor does. In contrast to a cell's DNA, its RNA the transcriptome is a highly dynamic machinery which operates within ranges, orders of magnitudes wider than those of the genome. Its role of shaping clonal evolution and implementing a cell's response to its environment is undoubted, yet nowhere close to understood. We seek applications from a computer scientist with a PhD and strong background in machine learning to develop general metrics of cell fitness using supervised machine learning approaches. This project is part of our NIH-awarded K99/R00.Position Highlights: We develop software solutions that enable data-driven, clinical, decision-making by providing oncologists and specialized tumor-boards with patient-specific genomic information. Executing this mission will rely on a long-term synergy between various evolving perspectives on tumor populations and on an interdisciplinary effort to sharpen these perspectives.The Ideal Candidate: Experience with machine learning approaches, especially supervised methods such as Bayesian MKL, deep neural networks (Bayesian neural nets, LSTM, convolutional) is required. Experience with PyTorch or TensorFlow is also needed. Prior work with very large datasets, such as CIFAR-10 and imaging data pre-processing is preferred but not required. Experience with Java and OO programing concepts is also a plus.Responsibilities: Successful candidate will work with a powerful combination of single-cell RNA sequencing data and live-cell imaging to learn various aspects about a clone's fitness from its transcriptome. Successful candidate will work closely together with mathematicians towards steering the fitness landscape of coexisting cancer clones in a systematic, directed fashion.Credentials and Qualifications: PhD in computer scienceHow to Apply: Please send your CV and cover letter to Dr. Noemi Andor at Noemi.Andor@Moffitt.orgLocation: H.
