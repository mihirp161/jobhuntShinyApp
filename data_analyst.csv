In addition, each employee is encouraged to use two paid work days per year to provide their labor and skills to the community.
Company Overview
Benchmark International is one of the world’s leading merger and acquisition specialists in the sale of mid-market companies. With offices throughout the world, we are in touch with all the major acquirers and consolidators who are constantly seeking both on and off-market opportunities across all sectors. The enterprise value of our transactions falls broadly within the $2 million to $500 million range, with most being between $5 million and $20 million. Our unique and dynamic international offering presents our clients with unparalleled global coverage, allowing them access through our exclusive databases and business intelligence facilities to both international markets and local representation.
Our client base consists almost entirely of owners actively involved in businesses they founded decades earlier. At times, multiple family members are involved. Our clients seek either an opportunity to exit their business or the means to ensure its continued future growth. They look to our company to find both an acquirer with the right fit and a transaction that provides maximum value and the correct structure. As a result of the dynamics of this market, our bespoke process has been developed specifically to handle not only the business aspects of these transactions but also their personal and emotional components.
Benchmark International began in the United Kingdom over a decade ago. Our Tampa headquarters opened in 2013 and continues to grow as our domestic client base and international buyer-contacts expand. We expanded into Texas in January 2016. 2017 brought office openings in South Africa, Ireland, and the United Kingdom. In January 2018 we opened another US office in Tennessee.
We offer our clients a unique business proposition that has resonated well with the US market as it has with markets in other countries. Recognizing that the US M&A markets are the most robust in the world, particularly in this coveted middle-market range, we are planning to expand our US presence in the coming years.
